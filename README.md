--Description--
Remote Sensor Server is a IoT based system, in which an ESP8266 module uploads data from an attached sensor module to ThingSpeak. A Raspberry Pi system then downloads the sensor data, and displays it on a local web server, where it can be viewed and monitored from a mobile device.
This project was designed to be easily expanded upon, with the option of multiple sensors uploading data at the same time, and it all being available on the local webserver
